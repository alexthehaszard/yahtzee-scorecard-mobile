# Yahtzee Scorecard Mobile App

This is a new project using [ReactLynx](https://lynxjs.org/react/), which (at the time of creation) is a brand new native app framework.

It will use an existing [yahtzee scorecard repo](https://github.com/alexthehaszard/yahtzee-scorecard) as a guide, for styling and functionality, as it has already been playtested and refined.

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to the project, you can assign an existing issue to yourself, or create a pull request directly. Contributions are welcomed. I will try to actively watch this repo for contributions and help out wherever I can.

To get your Lynx dev environment and live preview setup, [this](https://lynxjs.org/react/start/quick-start.html#explorer-platform=ios-simulator,ios-simulator-platform=macos-intel) may be helpful
